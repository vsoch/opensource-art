# Open Source Art

This is a collaboration between [@nsoch](https://www.github.com/nsoch) and [@vsoch](https://www.github.com/vsoch),
a mother daughter team that decided to have some fun and bring together their divergent interests of fine art and
programming to create something with sum larger than its parts. This folder contains application
materials intended for submission to the [Red Hat Open Gallery Call for Proposals](http://vaeraleigh.org/exhibitions/2018/7/10/red-hat-open-gallery-call-for-proposals). The programming part happens on here to encourage open source contribution of
textures and other inputs, and then to produce resulting works, and then the human hand again comes into play to
turn these digital inspirations into the actual pieces intended for the physical gallery.

## Application Materials

The following application materials are included here:

 - [Project Statement](project-statement.md) a summary (less than one page) that describes how the work here relates to Red Hat's Open Source Values.
                            RedHat Project statement Natacha Sochat and Vanessa Sochat

The conceptual nature of this proposal embodies how an open society benefits from all of its members participating in its well-being. ‘The whole can be greater than any one of its parts’, an old but true cliché. This is a core tenet of Open Source values. 
As a child of immigrants I am very aware of being UpRooted. As an adult, rather than viewing cultural uprooting as a loss, I see the world a fuller, richer condition in which the seemingly chaotic disruption of clashing cultures actually results in the creation of stronger hybrid roots. 
I will create an paintings that symbolize connectedness and strength. These paintings and objects will not be a wall of exclusion. They will embody the spirit of an open source society.
As an artist and biologist I use trees as a metaphor for connectedness on the microscopic and macroscopic scale.
We are inviting the public to participate in an art process via the web (https://vsoch.github.io/opensource-art/about/), as well as allowing me as an artist to express the strength of inclusiveness with paintings. These paintings will represent how we are all connected, and how we need a society that does not build walls, but rather facilitates strength by inclusion. My collaborator Vanessa Sochat is a software engineer that embodies open source values. She will be creating the site where the public may participate in this inclusive event.
The work of the public contributors will be visible by opening the URL provided. People may view it on their phones, their tablets, or their computers. 
I am using crocheting as a connector to the paintings because for me as an artist it involves the hand and my labor. The hand is the mind, and labor is a valuable social force that always needs to be valued.
In addition, the project uses Github as the medium in its process. GitHub as well as RedHat embody open source values.
 
 - [Budget](budget.md) includes a cost of materials and labor.
 - [Resumes](resumes) are included for each of @vsoch and @nsoch. Note that @vsoch is not a traditional artist, and does not have a history of exhibitions
 - [Proposed Timeline](proposed-timeline.md) a brief statement about expected timing for the exhibition.
 - [Inventory and Work Samples](inventory-samples) a folder with a guide and referenced samples that accompany this application
